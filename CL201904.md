1. linux command: nm ---> list symbols from object file.
	* Usage: `nm -C student-list.o`
2. Virtual function of base class must have defination, even it's a pure virtual function. 
	* defination and declaration of pure virtual function: 
		```
		virtual void Input(){};
		```
3. when using delete to free memory, the class must have defination of destructor, I don't know why;

### Tue Apr  2 08:39:02 CST 2019

1. const object call const functions, const object cannot call non-const functions.
	```
	static int ByAverage(const StudentData *p1, const StudentData *p2){
		const object call const function
		return p1->AverageScore() < p2->AverageScore();
	}
	float ArtsData::AverageScore() const{			// const function
		float res = 0;
		res = chin + engl + math + hist + geog;
		return res/5;
	}
	float ScienceData::AverageScore() const{		// const function
		float res = 0;
		res = chin + engl + math;
		res += biol + chem + phys;
		return res/6;
	}
	```
2. Virtual Function(late binding or dynamic binding)
	1. `_vptr`, hidden pointer, point to a virtual table `vTable`
		1. There is a member variable `_vptr` in base class
		2. There is a `_vptr` in derived class which is derived from base class 
		3. both base class and derived class have a `vTable`
	2. `vTable`, 
		1. `vTable` is an array store `Function pointer` 
		2. `Function pointer` point to the apropriate function, the function can be in both base class and derived class. 

3. name@address
4. istream/ostream is a buffer used for input or output

|method|source|destination|description|
|---|---|---|---|
|cout|buffer|device|buffer--->device|
|cin|device|buffer|device--->buffer|
|ofstream|buffer|file|
|ifstream|file|buffer|
|ostringstream|buffer|string|
|istringstream|string|buffer|

* from source to destination
* buffer is stream, buffer is associate with device/file/string
* use `>>` to put content from buffer
* use `<<` to extract content from buffer

### Wed Apr  3 08:38:18 CST 2019

1. Delete my header file named B by using `mv A to B` to overload the original file. It's important to save files and datas automaticlly.
2. Notice the consistency of string sequence when loading and saving files.

### Thu Apr  4 08:36:53 CST 2019

1. if `cin >> int_num` a string, what happens? It will set the buffer flag as an Error.
```
	int num;
	cin >> num;					// Enter a string "asdf"
	cin.clear();				// Clear all the error flags
	cin.ignore(10000, '\n');	// Ignore 10000 characters but stops
								// if encounters a newline
```
or I can use `cin.fail()` to check if badbit or failbits is set.
```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	int num = 0;
	cout << "Please input a number: ";
	cin >> num;
	while(true){
		if(cin.fail()){
			cout << "You have to enter an interger!" << endl;
			cin.clear(); 			// clear error flags
			cin.ignore(99999, '\n');
			cin >> num;
		}
		else{
			cout << "You have input a: " << num << endl;
			break;
		}
	}
	return 0;
}

```


### Mon Apr  8 07:14:22 CST 2019

1. Connect to my ubuntu with ssh:
	* `sudo apt-get	install openssh-server`	---> ssh.service
	* `sudo systemctl status ssh` ---> 	check ssh status
	* `ssh username@host` 		---> 	connecting
2. Separate **interface** from **implementation** helps multiplexing of code, it can be achieved like this way:
```
bool RemoveAllHelper();		// implements specific function
void RemoveAll();			// interface with users
```
3. Vim case sensitive ignore or not:
```
:set ignorecase				// ignorecase
:set noignorecase			// case sensitive
```
4. backup with rsync:
```
sudo rsync -aAXv --delete --dry-run --exclude=/dev/* --exclude=/proc/* --exclude=/sys/* --exclude=/tmp/* --exclude=/run/* --exclude=/mnt/* --exclude=/media/* --exclude="swapfile" --exclude="lost+found" / /media/leon/backup/20190407laptop		// dry run means simulate to test
sudo rsync -aAXv --delete --exclude=/dev/* --exclude=/proc/* --exclude=/sys/* --exclude=/tmp/* --exclude=/run/* --exclude=/mnt/* --exclude=/media/* --exclude="swapfile" --exclude="lost+found" / /media/leon/backup/20190407laptop					// real run
```


### Tue Apr  9 07:22:58 CST 2019

1. [TBD]Adjust the width of splited vim window:
	1. resize window:
		* `:Nq` ---> quit the Ntd window(window are numbered from top-left to bottom-right).
		* `z{n}<CR>` / `:res[ize] (+)N` ---> modify the height
			* `<C-W> +/-/=`			---> increase/decrease/defualt
		* `vertical res[ize] (+)N`	---> modify the width
			* `<C-W> </>/|`
		* `set (no)equalalways`/ `set (no)ea` 	---> set new window always the same or not
	2. moving windows around:
		* `C-W H/J/K/L` 			---> move to left/down/up/right
		* `C-W x` 					---> exchange with next one
		* `[N] C-W T` 				---> send to Nth/next tab
2. Vim tags:
	* `:[N]ta` 						---> jump to Nth tag
	* `{N}gt`/`{N}<C-PageDown}>`	---> goto next N tags
3. [TBD]Automatic test:
4. [TBD]How to avoid your code of a line excceeds 80 characters? 
5. [TBD]Design patterns:
	1. design class: hierarchy, attributes and method
	2. operation flow: complex system
6. merge experiment-branch to master and make all the things in master to the content of experiment-branch:
	* `git merge [-s <strategy>] [-X <strategy-option>]`
	* assuming you are in the master branch, you can type:`git merge -s recursive -X theirs experiment-branch-name`

### Wed Apr 10 08:35:40 CST 2019

1. [Tips] Each time you search a command in google, then you should write it down, and when you are in rest, read the manual of the certain meaning of that command;
2. The routine for writing a program is as following:
	1. Writing down the description/workflow/etc of program as more as you can think of.
	2. Think about the class I needs, Writing the **attributes** and **method** of these class.
	3. Think about the relationship between them. Drawing the **hierarchy graph** of all the class.
	4. Drawing down the **work flow graph**.
3. [TBD] Program source root directory, how to allocate for test?
4. [TBD] How to write test source for each class, and how the enter is arranged? 

### Fri Apr 12 08:35:37 CST 2019

1. How to turn off the ycm Semantics Analysis or Identifier Completer or Diagnostic Signs? Because it alway interrupts my thought when I'm coding. How to turn compile on/off manully?
	1. Both Semantic Analysis and Identifier Completer turn off: `g:ycm_auto_trigger=0`
	2. Identifier Completer turn off: `let g:ycm_min_num_of_chars_for_completion=99`
	3. Diagnostic ui(gutter signs, text highlighting, diagnostic echo, auto location list): 
		1. `g:ycm_show_diagnostics_ui`
		2. `g:ycm_enable_diagnostic_signs`
		3. `g:ycm_enable_diagnostic_highlighting`
		4. `g:ycm_echo_current_diagnostic`
		5. `g:ycm_always_populate_location_list`
2. Open files vertically in vim from command line: `vim -O file1 file2`
3. [TBD] Modularization some frequency tools such as: clean screen, system puase, etc. 
4. [TBD] Auto-maticlly make according the your file without writing makefile for each program.
5. [TBD] The sequence of member function in class, how to arrange their order to make my brain clear? 
6. [TBD] GDB auto update changed source, or should it be load manually by type `file *.out`?


### Sat Apr 13 06:29:44 CST 2019

1. [TBD] Constructor, user constructor or attributes of class to construct class to an object? 
2. When reading cpp_primier_fifth_edition, there is some tricky to use:
	1. using link with `f` followed by a link number to go to link page, and then **find the topic you want to check**(The books' title is pretty small even small than normal fonts so be careful to find it).
	2. Using `/` to find topic you are confused, such as `/constructor `
	3. GDB: delete more than one breakpoint at the same time, `d num1 num2`

### Mon Apr 15 05:41:54 CST 2019

1. Can `build` build a makefile?
	* [Using make and writing Makefiles](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~newhall/unixhelp/howto_makefiles.html)
	1. CMake generates makefiles for different platform. (usually the source use lots of libraries and platform-specified compilation issues).
	2. For small projects, writing makefiles by hand is likely easier.
	3. Creating a Makefile:
		* Example:
		```
		# comment
		# (note: the <tab> in the command line is necessy for make to work)
		target: dependency1 dependency2
			<tab> command

		# for example:
		# target entry to build program executable from program and mylib
		# object files
		program: program.o mylib.o
			g++ -o program program.o mylib.o
		```
		* a more generic simple makefile(uses makefile variables)
			```
			# the compiler: gcc for c, g++ for c++
			CC = gcc

			# compiler flags:
			# -g adds debugging information to the executable file
			# -Wall turns on most, but not all, compiler warnings
			GFLAGS = -g -Wall

			# the build target executable:
			TARGET = myprog

			all: $(TARGET)
			$(TARGET): $(TARGET).c
				$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $(TARGET) $(TARGET).c

			clean:
				$(RM) $(TARGET)
			```
		* an example of building an executable from multiple .o files:

			```
			# 'make depend' uses makedepend to automatically generate dependencies 
			#               (dependencies are added to end of Makefile)
			# 'make'        build executable file 'mycc'
			# 'make clean'  removes all .o and executable files
			#

			# define the C compiler to use
			CC = gcc

			# define any compile-time flags
			CFLAGS = -Wall -g

			# define any directories containing header files other than /usr/include
			#
			INCLUDES = -I/home/newhall/include  -I../include

			# define library paths in addition to /usr/lib
			#   if I wanted to include libraries not in /usr/lib I'd specify
			#   their path using -Lpath, something like:
			LFLAGS = -L/home/newhall/lib  -L../lib

			# define any libraries to link into executable:
			#   if I want to link in libraries (libx.so or libx.a) I use the -llibname 
			#   option, something like (this will link in libmylib.so and libm.so:
			LIBS = -lmylib -lm

			# define the C source files
			SRCS = emitter.c error.c init.c lexer.c main.c symbol.c parser.c

			# define the C object files 
			#
			# This uses Suffix Replacement within a macro:
			#   $(name:string1=string2)
			#         For each word in 'name' replace 'string1' with 'string2'
			# Below we are replacing the suffix .c of all words in the macro SRCS
			# with the .o suffix
			#
			OBJS = $(SRCS:.c=.o)

			# define the executable file 
			MAIN = mycc

			#
			# The following part of the makefile is generic; it can be used to 
			# build any executable just by changing the definitions above and by
			# deleting dependencies appended to the file from 'make depend'
			#

			.PHONY: depend clean

			all:    $(MAIN)
					@echo  Simple compiler named mycc has been compiled

			$(MAIN): $(OBJS) 
					$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(INCLUDES) -o $(MAIN) $(OBJS) $(LFLAGS) $(LIBS)

			# this is a suffix replacement rule for building .o's from .c's
			# it uses automatic variables $<: the name of the prerequisite of
			# the rule(a .c file) and $@: the name of the target of the rule (a .o file) 
			# (see the gnu make manual section about automatic variables)
			.c.o:
					$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(INCLUDES) -c $<  -o $@

			clean:
					$(RM) *.o *~ $(MAIN)

			depend: $(SRCS)
					makedepend $(INCLUDES) $^

			# DO NOT DELETE THIS LINE -- make depend needs it

			```

2. How to make confirmation before remove file?
3. Must **give a git commit** after everyday work
4. What is different between include and lib?
	* include 	---> 	uncompiled object code including `.h` and `.cpp` files
	* lib 		---> 	compiled object code usually `.a` or `.so` file
5. [TBD] The different between `.a` and `.so`:[Ref this page](http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LibraryArchives-StaticAndDynamic.html)
	* `.a`: Static libraries, Library of object code which is linked with, and becomes part of the application.
	* `.so`: Dynamically linked shared object libraries. It can be used in two ways:
		* Dynamically linked at run time. The libraries must be aviliable during compile/link phase. The shared objects are not included into the executable component but are tied to the execution.
		* Dynamically loaded/unloaded and linked during execution using the dynamic linking loader system functions.
	* Library naming conventions:
		* Libraries are typically named with the prefix "lib". The command line reference to the library will not contain the library prefix or suffix. Such as, `gcc src.cpp -lm -lpthread`, which inclusion is math library and thread library. They are found in /usr/lib/libm.a and /usr/lib/libpthread.a. 
6. [TBD] When I using `ln ~/workspace/cpp/mytools tools`, I was told "hard link not allowed for directory", Why and How to impletment the same functions? 
7. [TBD] What the meaning of `<Bar>` in vimrc, I found [This page](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/2286/what-does-bar-mean), but didn't read it. 


### Tue Apr 16 06:21:12 CST 2019

1. `ls -R` list directory recursively.
2. [TBD] Ubuntu unattended upgr:[Ref page](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/374748/ubuntu-update-error-waiting-for-unattended-upgr-to-exit)
3. `xdg-open` open a file or URL in the user's preferred application.
4. [bash shell cheat sheet](https://devhints.io/bash#functions), human readable document [Bash Hackers Wiki](https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/start)
5. A cheat sheet is good for beginning a new skill.

### Fri Apr 19 08:45:55 CST 2019

1. Search word under cursor in vim: `*`, and then you press `n/N` to the next/prev occurence. 
2. emacs, the most powerful front-end of gdb in command line. 
3. Usage of ctags with vim:
	1. <C-]> : Jump to the tag underneath the cursor
	2. <C-t> : Jump back up in the tag stack
	3. `:ts` : List all of the definition of the last tag
	4. `:tn/p`: Go the next/previous definition for the last tag
