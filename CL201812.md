1. 17 days have passed since December. I just remember to write worklog here. WorkLog is a good habit to maintain, and it worth a lifelong time to keep. So don't forget it anymore. 
2. Just begin work don't waste any time. 
3. xdg-open: open a file or URL in the user's preferred application, it equals to double click to the file;
