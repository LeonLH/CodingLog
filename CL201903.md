### Fri Mar  8 08:48:17 CST 2019
1. [TBD] remote debug with gdb. 
2. [TBD] automaticly select if using shadowsocks according to GFWlist.
3. [D] How to avoid dns poisoning in computer? Require: firefox version 62++, [Ref](https://wangejiba.com/3913.html)
	1. type `about:config` in the address bar;
	2. search `network.trr` in the search box;
	3. double click `network.trr.mode`, change the value from 0 to 2;
	4. double click `network.trr.uri`, change the value to some unpoisoned dns server, e.g. `https://mozill.cloudflare-dns/dns-query`;
	5. In addition, you can type `about:networking` in the address bar to select the dns options and check dns status.
	6. Thouth the above 1-4 steps, you have open the DoH function of firefox, which can avoid dns-poisoning. 
4. [TBD] How to avoid dns poisoning in mobile and ipad? 
5. [TBD] How to read c++ manual, such as stl containers' manual, in linux offline? 
6. [D] how to make it work when debugging program which have system call with gdb. 
	1. Don't use system() untill you have to do! [Ref](http://www.cplusplus.com/articles/j3wTURfi/). If you want to clear the screen, instead of using system("clear"), you can try `cout << "\033[2J\033[1;1H";`. This is ANSI escape code[Ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Escape_sequences).
8. [D] How to write some code and test the code? 
	1. write one class and test that class, each class can have a function `test()` to test methods of its own. 

### Sat Mar  9 08:36:54 CST 2019

1. gdb Examining Memory
	1. `x/nfu addr` e.g. `x/8cb`
	2. if you print the value with `p value1`, then the `addr` will be set at the value's address, you don't need to type the address.
	3. if you type `x/4`, gdb will show the next 4 addr memory from last place you leave, type `enter` is repeat last command.
2. [TBD] istringstream 	
```
#include<iostream>
#include<sstream>
#include<fstream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	string tmp, tmp1;
	fstream ifs("test.txt");
	istringstream is;				// Doesn't work. 
	while(getline(ifs, tmp)){
		is.str(tmp);
		//istringstream is;			// It works in here. 
		for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
			is >> tmp1; 
			cout << tmp1 << " ";
		}
		cout << endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
```

3. [TBD] make gdb tab 4 space. 


### Sun Mar 10 08:37:08 CST 2019

1. [D] How to make program stop when running with gdb? `CTRL-C` and then type `finish` to step out of function or type `bt`(backtrack) to show one line per frame. 
2. [D] Can poiter be coercion transformated from some inheritance class to his parent class? Yes, it can. 
3. [TBD] How to check the element in std::list? Or how to check the memory of the list? 
	1. For struct: It can be quickly checked by typing `p structname`;
	2. For class: using pretty-print or memory check with `x/nfu addr`;
4. [D] gdb, check the current line, type `info line`
5. [TBD] Find a special time to study gdb. 
6. [TBD] How to copy address in gdb without mouse? 

### Mon Mar 11 08:39:44 CST 2019

1. [D]The `pstring` of pretty-print in gdb doesn't work.
	* solved by refering the gdb [STLsupport](https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/STLSupport)
2. [TBD]GNU screen to copy the content in the screen:
	0. `screen` in command line to get into screen mode
	1. <C-A-[> ---> get into copy mode
	2. `Enter` ---> start to select
	3. select some content
	4. Enter ---> finish select
	5. <C-A-]> ---> paste
3. [TBD] How to make istringstream's outstream inject different data to different type? 
		* just output it with `>>`;
4. GDB needn't re-file the file when source code is modified, The only thing you need to do is compile the source and re-run .out file.
5. [D] Print all variables:
	* `info variables` to list "All global and static variables";
	* `info locals` to list "Local variables of current stack frame" including static variables in that function;
	* `info args` to list "Arguments of the current stack frame".
6. [D] Dashboard:
	1. `source ~/.gbdinit_dashboard` ---> load dashboard configuration;
	2. `dashboard -output /dev/pts/8` ---> output to tty which is /dev/pts/8;
	3. `dashboard memory watch addr 80`---> watch addr and 80 lines after;
7. [TBD] typing exercises with gtypist especially in these characters: `\`, `-`, `+`, `'`, `|`, etc. `
8. [D] use getchar() to make program puase:
```
cout << "Press any key to continue...";
getchar();
```

9. [D] gdb prompt 
	* `set prompt >> `

### Tue Mar 12 08:53:14 CST 2019

		* Namespace Names
		* Enumerator Names
		* Macro Names
		* Exceptions to Naming Rules


### Wed Mar 13 08:37:33 CST 2019

1. [D] How to read stl(standard template library) containers reference offline in linux:
	1. cpp header: e.g. `/usr/include/c++/7/bits`
	2. current system don't have the source code of containers, we should search in the internet.

2. [TBD] How to set tab width of gdb? 	Maybe it can't. 

3. [TBD] 开发程序流程，提升效率；
	1. 例如先写下模块之间的关系；
	2. 每写一个模块之前，写下他的功能以及实现的特别之处(如无必要，则不写)；

4. [TBD] make all code to the google style c++;

### Sat Mar 16 22:19:01 CST 2019

1. [TBD] Neteast-cloud-music can't launch in when reboot ubuntu after installed:
	* 

### Wed Mar 20 06:51:03 CST 2019

1. Grid window: `sudo apt-get install compizconfig-setting-manager`, and ensure that `Grid` is checked. 
2. [TBD] C++ scope:
	1. scope resolution operator: `::`
	2. 
3. [D] C++ keyword `static`:
	1. static variables in function: 
		1. it gets allocated for the lifetime of the program. 
	2. static variables in class: 
		1. the static variables in a class are shared by the objects. 
		2. class-wide field: they don't belong to specific objects, they belong to the class.
	3. static objects: similar to static variables. 
	4. static member function: 
		1. can only access static members(data and members).
4. [D] C++ keyword `extern`:
	1. declared in header: `extern type var_name`
	2. defined once in one of source file: `type var_name`
	3. can be used in all files which includes header.	
	* outmost level of program. 
	* must be defined in some place which is visiable to all.
5. [TBD] backup the important file of ubuntu. 
6. How to make C++ puase? 
```
cin.ignore();	//extract and discard characters
cin.get();
```


### Thu Mar 21 07:55:13 CST 2019

1. There can't be a space after `\\`, if you want to use it to break current line to avoid make your program lines longer than 80. 
2. [TBD] After sort, the list is refector. How can I sort the list without changing the list? 
3. function pointer:
	* the return and parameters are same, only the name of function is different, all these function can be pointed by a function pointer.
	* this pointer can represent above similar functions. 
4. polymorphism of c++:
	1. You have different classes with a function of the same name, and even the same parameters, but with different implementations. 
	2. virtual function:
		1. defined in a base class
		2. with another version in a derived class
		3. don't want compiler to make static linkage signal for itself
		* dynamic linkage or later binding
5. [TBD] Refactor student-software to implement polymorphism.

1. [TBD] Master the skill of quickly reading document and extracting useful informations. 
2. [TBD] Open file with their defualt application in ubuntu.
3. linux software option usage: 
	1. Usage example 1: Option: -B, --block-size=SIZE
		* du B MB file/directory
		* du --block-size=MB
	2. Usage example 2: Option: -d, --max-depth=N
		* du d 2 filename
		* du --max-depth=2
4. [TBD] linux time: atime, access, use, ctime, status, etc.
