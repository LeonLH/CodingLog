1. I must repeat many times of the simgle project such as StudInfoManaSys, thus I can improve my skill of using C++ and get more familiar with the features of C++.
2. For multi-file program, we should use makefile to compile and link multiple files, and each time I changed time file I should only compile the changed one and still run the last executive file. 
3. Inorder to avoidmultiple definition of class member functions we should:
	1. (if necessary) add `#include "filename.h"` to .cpp file;
	2. should add `#pragma once` to each of .h files;

1. Usage of getline:
```
	char s[15];				// #include <iostream>
							// std:basic_istream::getline
	cin.getline(s, 10);		// cin.getline(char* s, streamsize n)
	cout << s;				// extract from input and store them 
							// into c-string. 

	string str;				// #include <string>
	getline(cin, str); 		// std::getline(basic_string)
							// getline(stream &is, string s)
	cout << s;          	// Get line form stream into string

```
2. [TBD] Is it feasible to store different kind of pointer into the same list?

1. [TBD] `system(clear)` doesn't work when debug with gdb, how to solve it?  
	1. This problem involves thread debug, because if you call the system function, it will begin a new thread as a child of current thread.

2. The workspace layout is arrange as this way(represent with index of matrix):
	1. 1st line is primary workspace:
		1. (1, 1) is **main** workspace;
		2. (1, 2) is **temporary** workspace, There are always temporary files stored here;
		3. (1, 3) is **log** workspace;
	2. 2nd line is test space, it store some test files in the same column of the 1st and 2nd row;
	3. 3rd line is **study** workspace, such as some tutorial/manual/textbook/etc.
		1. (3, 1) is empty;
		2. (3, 2) is python;
		3. (3, 3) is uml tutorial;

3. Usage of info:
	1. Basic Usage:
		1. `Up/Down` Move up/down one line
		2. `PgUp/PgDown` Scroll back/forward one screenful.
		3. `Home/End` Go to the beginning/end of this node.
		4. `TAB` next hypertext link, `Enter` follow hypertext link;
		5. `l` last seen node, `[/]` previous/next node in doc.
		6. `p/n` previous/next node in this level.
		7. `u/t/d` go up one level / go to top level / go to main DIR
		8. `/` search, `{/}` previous/next occurance.
